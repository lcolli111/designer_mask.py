# fact.py
This is a simple program that computes factorial equations. User inputs allows you to enter a number under eleven. Numbers are given in sequence starting with the number itself and down to 1, as shown in the following example:
Example: 4!
4x3x2x1=
24
For this project, I have included three functions and a master loop which allows the user to input a positive number from 0-10. If you choose a positive number within this range, then you will be prompted with a yes or no question which gives you the option to continue or exit the program. If your number is too large or is too negative, the loop continues until you've satisfied the number range requirements from 0-10.
0 will multiply as 0x1 and will equal 1. This is a bug I'm still in the process of fixing. Also, some operating systems may require you to enter y using "" down in the console but should still run. You may also use single quotes as well. I have included a list of the numbers from which to choose, along with a len function that tells the user how many items are in the list with the understanding that a list array starts at 0 instead of 1.
